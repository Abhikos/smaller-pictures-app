# Smaller Pictures App

## Overview

A Web Worker based image encoder written as a Progressive Web App.

### Getting Started

This app is based on the [Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit) build process. You'll want to run `npm install` to grab all of the dependencies we use.

Commands you'll find useful:

* `gulp` - generates a production-ready build of the app
* `gulp serve:dist` - generates and serves a production-ready version of the app for deployment
* `gulp serve` - locally previews the app (note: this will not transpile ES2015. Ensure your browser supports classes)
